Python Highlighter Function
===============================

A python function that highlight document snippets that match a query. 
For example, a search for `deep dish pizza` returns documents that match the query as well as highlights that try to show why the document is relevant. 

The Python Highlighter

2. Are not necessarily the full document (they are instead only a relevant snippet);
3. The given text is highlighted with [[HIGHLIGHT]]â€¦[[ENDHIGHLIGHT]]

Example:

`highlight_doc("I like fish. Little star's deep dish pizza sure is fantastic. Dogs are funny.", "deep dish pizza") -> "Little star's [[HIGHLIGHT]]deep dish pizza[[ENDHIGHLIGHT]] sure is fantastic."`
